              Denerative Disc Disease (DDD) or Spondylosis refers to the gradual
              deterioration of the disc between the vertebrae in the backbone.
              This disease is very common, and affects as much as 40-50% of
              people over the age of 40. The disorder also becomes increasingly
              common as we age. It is a disease of wear and tear similar to
              osteoarthritis. It commonly happens in the lumbar spine (low
              back), though it can occur at any spinal level. In DDD, the discs
              get flattened, losing their normal height. This disc height is
              what separates the disc above from the one below. Nerve pathways
              may become narrowed and cause nerve impingement, inflammation, and
              pain, when the disc height is lost. Degenerated discs become much
              thinner and sometimes the vertebrae also develop small, rough
              areas which irritate the nearby nerves. Severe neck pain and
              stiffness and pain down the arms and hands can result from this .
              Medication and exercises are the first line of management.
